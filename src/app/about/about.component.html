        <h4>My Story</h4>
        <hr>
        <p class="text-left col-md-10 mx-auto">
            I am a student currently attending the University of Illinois at Chicago seeking a degree in Computer Science. I has been programming for roughly about 7 years now with
            extensive knowledge of many different languages including C++, C, Java, HTML, CSS, JS, Angular, Flutter, and many more! I was raised in Tennessee where I started my journey
            learning about programming and computers in general at about age 12. I started with Visual Basic to learn how to make my own applications. About this time I learned how to build
            a computer which helped push me forward as I started to be able to more clearly understand how computers work. Unfortunately, I had very little resources, so my learning was
            limited to YouTube and outdated books. Later down the road I started learning Java and HTML. This was about the time I starting thinking about my first PC build.
            I slowly added to the list of languages over time. When I was adopted by my now parents, I had gained more resources and this allowed me to start entering into the
            area of IT and Security. I built my second and third computer within the coming years from odd jobs. I had built a large server rack from old and donated computers
            which allowed me to gain a more in-depth understanding of server hardware such as RAID and networking. Some books I read taught me about Active Directory administration
            these books were focused mostly around Windows 2000, but they were instrumental in allowing me to understand computers at a deeper level. The Arduino was my
            biggest foray in Electronics. This pushed me to make small projects such as smart electronics and stereo visualizers. During High School, I was able to speak with
            most of my Computer Science teachers at the same level which allowed me to gain a lot of information about the work which pushed me to pursue it as a career.
            When I took band, computers fell into the background at that point, but certaintly not forgotten. When I moved to Illinois, I had my first job working with
            electronics at uBreakiFix. This job has taught me many invaluable qualities, I learned hard skills such as working with small electronics, certifications, 
            and explaining complex problems to customers. I graduated from Mundelein High School in May of 2019. I decided that I would go to UIC to continue my education
            and learn more about Computer Science. I am still working at uBreakiFix, and I love what I do!
